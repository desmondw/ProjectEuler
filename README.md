Project Euler
=============
Last edit before repo: 8/21/12

Project Euler is a website where you can solve over 400 logical problems. The site posits the problem, and asks for an answer (usually a number) which you can input on their site to get matched to see if you're right. It's kind of like practice work for programmers. I used it to pickup Python which is great for hacking something like this together quickly.
